# odin-recipes
I'm going to build a basic recipe website that will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is. I will be using my newly aquired skill, HTML CSS  and git and github.
