    <h2>Salsa verde pork</h2>
    <p>Quick prep work leads to succulent, delicious, and exceptionally easy pork for enchiladas, tamales, or burritos or even to eat all by itself! We use this pork in all sorts of things, but my husband's favorite way is simply right out of the pot. I can't trust him to do the shredding, because too much ends up in his mouth. This pork keeps well and gets even better after a day or two.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) boneless pork loin roast</li>
        <li>11 ounces green salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown pork loin in hot oil, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer roast to the crock of a slow cooker. Pour green salsa over the pork.</li>
        <li>Cook on Low for 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Shred the pork into strands with two forks; stir with the sauce so the texture is somewhat even. Continue cooking on Low for 1 to 3 hours more.</li>
